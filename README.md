# Lexical Markers of Sustainable Fashion

This project analyzes lexical differences between sustainable and mainstream fashion product descriptions using machine learning.

## Objective
To investigate whether textual descriptors alone can distinguish sustainable fashion products from fast-fashion items.

## Methodology
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF feature extraction (300 features)
- Logistic Regression classifier
- 5-fold cross-validation

## Results
- Train-test F1: High separation observed
- Cross-validation Mean F1: 0.78
- Std Deviation: 0.16
- Dataset-source bias detected

## Key Insights
- Sustainable products emphasize natural fibers (cotton, linen, hemp).
- Fast fashion emphasizes demographic segmentation and aesthetic descriptors.
